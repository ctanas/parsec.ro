# parsec.ro

Files used for [parsec.ro](https://www.parsec.ro) website, generated from [this org-file](https://github.com/ctanas/parsec.ro/blob/master/content-org/index.org) (so it's not a good idea to alter any .md files from this repository --note to self).

The org-mode source file is exported to Markdown trough [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) package, from Emacs, then parsed by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) into the final, static HTML form (hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)). A slighty modified version of [hugo-alageek-theme](https://github.com/gkmngrgn/hugo-alageek-theme) is used for coating.
