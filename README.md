# parsec.ro

Hugo files for [parsec.ro](www.parsec.ro) website, generated from [this org-file](https://github.com/ctanas/parsec-source/blob/master/struct.org), so it's not a good idea to alter any .md files from this repository (note to self).

A slighty modified version of [hugo-alageek-theme](https://github.com/gkmngrgn/hugo-alageek-theme) is used for coating.
