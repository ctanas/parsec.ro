# parsec.ro

Files used for [parsec.ro](https://www.parsec.ro) website, generated from [this org-file](https://github.com/ctanas/parsec-source/blob/master/struct.org), so it's not a good idea to alter any .md files from this repository (note to self).  The source file is exported to Markdown trough [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) package from Emacs, then parsed by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) into the final, static HTML form (parsed and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)). A slighty modified version of [hugo-alageek-theme](https://github.com/gkmngrgn/hugo-alageek-theme) is used for coating.
